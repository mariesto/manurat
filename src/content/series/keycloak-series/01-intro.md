## Background
Currently, in [Fazz](https://fazz.com/) I'm joining Auth Team where we are using Keycloak as our internal IAM and SSO system. Special thanks to [Taufan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taufan4ace/) for providing the idea and do the review. Within this series, I want to share my experience of using Keycloak so you can use this series as one of your references. 

## What to cover
Actually, before we stepping to Keycloak, there are some context you need to aware in the first place. I will try to cover some of the things along side this series, but recommending you to have some context to make it easier to understand this series. You might need to explore about :
- OpenID Connect
- OAuth2
