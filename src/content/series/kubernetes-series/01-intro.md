## Background
Currently, in [Fazz](https://fazz.com/) I got a project which require me to hands on about k8s. Since I didn't have hands on experience about k8s, I create this series as my attempt to document what I've learned about k8s. Special thanks to [Taufan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taufan4ace/) for providing the idea and do the review.

<Callout type="warning">
  This series will cover some of the basic usage and using local env only.
  Next step, will consider to onboard the project into Cloud, stay tuned!
