## Background
Currently, in my company (Fazz) I got a project which require me to hands on about k8s. Since I didn't have hands on experience about k8s, I create this series as my attempt to document what I've learned about k8s. 

<Callout type="warning">
  This series will only cover the basic usages and using local env only.
  Next step, will consider to onboard the project into Cloud, stay tuned! 😉
