## Background
Currently, in in [Fazz](https://fazz.com/) I got a project which require me to hands on about k8s. Since I didn't have hands on experience about k8s, I create this series as my attempt to document what I've learned about k8s. Special thanks to [Taufan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taufan4ace/) for providing the idea and do the review.

<Callout type="warning">
  This series will only cover the basic usages and using local env only.
  Next step, will consider to onboard the project into Cloud, stay tuned! ðŸ˜‰

We will try to cover :
- Basic usage of kubernetes
- HPA
- Using Promotheus for monitoring
- Load testing using k6
